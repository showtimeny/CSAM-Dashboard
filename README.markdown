==Summary==
The Client Services Dashboard should exist as the homepage for CSAMs, and include immediate relevant information for all publisher accounts managed by that CSAM.

==Contents==
The Client Services Dashboard should include a data snapshot of the most important information relative to individual accounts, and a homepage with relevant "top" cross-publisher information.

Please, for the love of all that is still good in this world, let's let this be a simple HTML output. kthx.

==Security==
The Client Services Dashboard should live outside of portal, and only be accessible within the Admeld network or over VPN.
